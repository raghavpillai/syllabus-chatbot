*All examinations will be at the Testing Center (https://ets.utdallas.edu/testing-center).
Seats will fill up quickly; students are encouraged to register for ALL three exams early in
advance during the first two weeks of semester.
*Failure to take the exam due to incorrect registration or absence will result in score of
zero for that exam, NO EXCEPTIONS.

Course & Instructor Policies:
Exams

All three exams will be at the Testing Center. All students are required to register
and reserve seats at the center at least 48 hours before the exam. This 48-hour deadline
is strictly followed by the testing center. If a student misses an exam due to not registering
48 hours prior to the exam, this will constitute a ZERO for the exam. No Exceptions will
be made for missing the exam due to missed or incorrect registration.
All exams could be registered in the first few weeks of the semester, once registered
a confirmation email will be sent to the student. It is the student responsibility to ensure
proper registration and to follow all the guidelines and dress code restrictions given in the
Testing center website.
Exams must be taken on time. Exceptions require advance approval by the
instructor. It is up to the instructor to determine whether an exception will be made and
will depend largely on proof of extraordinary circumstances. Otherwise, a missed exam
will either incur a substantial penalty or be recorded as a zero. All Exams are 100% online
with multiple choice and essay questions.
Make-Up Exams

Make-Up exams will be administered only under extreme extenuating
circumstances like hospitalization or road accidents. Proof of such incident is required to
request a Make-Up and will be approved after instructors’ discretion. MakeUp exams are
100% on paper with only essay questions.
Assignments

All assignments will be available via elearning and must be submitted via elearning
as well. No email submission allowed. Assignments must be turned in on time. All
assignments will be due on eLearning. Late submissions will be accepted, but any late
submission made within 24 hours of when the assignment is due will have its score
deducted by 10%, the maximum score possible. Late submissions made more than 24 but
less than 48 hours after the assignment is due will have the score deducted an additional

Course Syllabus Fall 2023 CS 4349_001

Page 4

10% (so 20% total). No points will be awarded for submissions more than 48 hours late.
Even after deductions, scores cannot be negative. It is your responsibility to upload your
work early enough to avoid possible problems uploading to eLearning. It is your
responsibility to ensure that you have submitted the correct items. It is recommended that
you double-check your submission to ensure it is correct.
All Assignments are to be individual efforts. You are allowed to collaborate with other
students, or to discuss solutions with other students, but make sure that the work you submit
is your own and not simply copied from other students’ work. Copying of Assignments in
whole or in part, from other students in this semester or previous semesters will be
considered an act of scholastic dishonesty. There will be no makeup exams or other extra
credit opportunities in the semester.
No makeup work is possible for Assignments, but the lowest Assignment score will be
dropped before calculating Assignment Total.
Sample Exams

There are three sample exams corresponding to three exams, these exams are very
similar in format to the actual exams. The purpose of these exams is for students to practice.
These exams will be available via eLearning and will not be graded but participation credit
will be given if attempted before the due date. These attempts will be considered in
calculating the Class Participation credit.
Participation Quizzes

Participation Quizzes will be available via elearning multiple times throughout the
semester. These quizzes will not be graded but participation credit will be given if the
quizzes are attempted before the due date. Students will be able to attempt the quiz multiple
times even though a single attempt per quiz is sufficient to score the participation credit for
that quiz. These attempts will be considered in calculating the Class Participation credit.
Class Attendance

Regular and punctual class attendance is expected. Attendance will be taken in
every class, and this will constitute a part of Class Participation credit. Attendance will be
taken as an elearning Quiz, students need to login into elearning and take the
Attendance Quiz in every class. Students who fail to attend class regularly are inviting
scholastic difficulty. Attendance score will be used in calculating Class Participation credit.
Every student is allowed up to 3 absences per semester with no excuse, more if proper
documentation is given for a valid excuse.
Class Participation

Regular class participation is expected. Students who fail to participate in class
regularly are inviting scholastic difficulty. A portion of the grade for this course is directly
tied to your participation in this class. It also includes engaging in groups or other activities
Course Syllabus Fall 2023 CS 4349_001

during class that solicit your feedback on homework assignments, readings, or materials
covered in the lectures (and/or labs). Class participation is documented by faculty.
Successful participation is defined as consistently adhering to University requirements, as
presented in this syllabus. Failure to comply with these University requirements is a
violation of the Student Code of Conduct.
Additional Videos

In addition to regular class and lecture, the student will be required to watch
additional videos covering some class material or providing help with Assignments. These
additional videos will be released every week. There will be at least one hour and at most
2 hours of video released every week. Students will be expected to watch these videos in
timely manner and contribute to class discussions pertaining to these videos.
Email Correspondence with the Instructor.

Any courses related questions can be asked via email to the instructor. It is the
instructor’s policy to respond to every email within 24 hours, if a response is not given in
24 hours, the student is encouraged to email again. On occasions, the instructor gets too
many emails and might forget to respond or read the email, student patience is highly
appreciated in this matter.
Class Assessment Surveys

There are three class assessment surveys, one at the Beginning of the Semester, one
at the Middle and one at the end of the semester. The end of semester survey is the official
UTD course evaluation survey taken from the website eval.utdallas.edu . The other two
surveys will be via elearning. All surveys are anonymous. Surveys are considered as
feedback from students which becomes essential part of course design and course conduct
modifications. Feedback from students via these surveys encourages and motivates the
instructor to perform optimally at teaching the course and helps in better course design.
Class Materials

The instructor may provide class materials that will be made available to all
students registered for this class as they are intended to supplement the classroom
experience. These materials may be downloaded during the course; however, these
materials are for registered students' use only. Classroom materials may not be reproduced
or shared with those not in class or uploaded to other online environments except to
implement an approved Office of Student AccessAbility accommodation. Failure to
comply with these University requirements is a violation of the Student Code of Conduct.

Class Recordings

Students are expected to follow appropriate University policies and maintain the
security of passwords used to access recorded lectures. Unless the Office of Student
AccessAbility has approved the student to record the instruction, students are expressly
prohibited from recording any part of this course. Recordings may not be published,
reproduced, or shared with those not in the class, or uploaded to other online environments
except to implement an approved Office of Student AccessAbility accommodation. Failure
to comply with these University requirements is a violation of the Student Code of
Conduct.
The instructor may record meetings of this course. These recordings will be made
available to all students registered for this class, the intent is to supplement the classroom
experience.
Accommodations for Students with Disabilities

The University of Texas at Dallas is committed to providing reasonable
accommodations for all persons with disabilities. The syllabus is available in alternate
formats upon request. If you are seeking classroom accommodations under the Americans
with Disabilities Act (2008), you are required to register with the AccessAbility Resource
Center (ARC), located in the Administration Building, Suite 2.224. Their phone number is
972-883-2098,
email: studentaccess@utdallas.edu and
the
website
is https://accessability.utdallas.edu/. To receive academic accommodations for this class,
please register and request services by completing the Request for Services form with the
proper documentation and meet with the Director of ARC at the beginning of the semester.

Academic Integrity

The faculty expects from its students a high-level of responsibility and academic
honesty. Because the value of an academic degree depends upon the absolute integrity of
the work done by the student for that degree, it is imperative that a student demonstrates a
high standard of individual honor in his or her scholastic work.
See https://conduct.utdallas.edu/integrity.
Academic Dishonesty: Academic dishonesty can occur in relation to any type of
work submitted for academic credit or as a requirement for a class. It can include individual
work or a group project. Academic dishonesty includes plagiarism, cheating, fabrication,
and collaboration/collusion. In order to avoid academic dishonesty, it is important for
students to fully understand the expectations of their professors. This is best accomplished
through asking clarifying questions if an individual does not completely understand the
requirements of an assignment.
Additional information related to academic dishonesty and tips on how to avoid
dishonesty may be found here: https://conduct.utdallas.edu/dishonesty.
